**Dynamic Website:** I use DrissionPage for handling Cloudflare

**Static Website:** I'm lazy and that's why I gave this task to the proxy aggregator scrapeops


## Lessons Learnedüéì
#### I learned how to bypass antibot mechanisms.

I faced significant challenges while trying to bypass the most difficult antibot system I've encountered.  
Initially, I tried various methods, many of which required paid services. While I know how to use these paid services,  
I chose to find my own solution. Through persistent trial and error, I eventually succeeded in bypassing the antibot  
protection on my own.
